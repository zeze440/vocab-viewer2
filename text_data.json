Believing them to be made of real gold, the boy would stare at the house and imagine all the wonderful things inside it. He promised himself that he would visit it someday and see for himself. On the morning of the boy’s birthday, his father told him to stay home and relax. The boy knew this was his chance. After his father left, he started walking towards the house with the golden windows. Soon it was late afternoon, but he kept walking. As he got closer, however, he could see that the windows were not made of gold. In fact, the house was small and old. Thinking he must have reached the wrong house, the boy knocked on the door. A boy his age opened it. He asked him if he knew where the house with the golden windows was. The boy said he did. With the sun beginning to set, he pointed back the way the boy had come.
